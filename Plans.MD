The website that we have been working on for our project is an application titled Topick. This application involved an interface that allows for users to create and join rooms based on what their topics of interest are. The user who creates the room can set a room size to allow a certain number of people to join. The people in the call would then be able to talk, message, and listen to music together. People in the room would be able to propose a song to listen to and the host would be able to confirm it, and the group can then listen to the song together. The music would be coming from Spotify. Spotify API would be integrated into the website that would allow for users to be able to search for music they desire to listen to and as well as create a queue of music to be played for the room that the host would also be able to see. Our future revision for this project would be to actually get the spotify api to work properly and for features found in applications like zoom to be incorporated into our rooms as well. Our rooms currently allow for us to view the video feed of other users, but ideally we would also like to incorporate other features. For example, we would want to incorporate things like a mute/unmute button or hide/show video. As well as something like giving yourself a background for your video feed.

We also want to be able to incorporate the spotify api to display below the video feed the song that is currently playing in the room. We also would also like to display a playlist or queue of sorts along with the song being displayed in order to show the users in the room the songs that will be playing next. Another aspect of our project that we would like to improve as well would be with the user experience when trying to find rooms. We would like to really allow for the "View all topics " section to work as well as dynamically loading in the topic names for each room. Ideally, the server would keep track of all the rooms' data such as topic name, room #, # of people, and we would load it into the client.

One other significant change that we would bring to our project is another feature that would work in tandem with the spotify api. After linking your spotify account to your topick account, the website would use the data from your spotify account for when you want to create a topic. The userâ€™s favorite artists and artists found in playlists you have made and put together recommended room topics to create based on the artists/genres found in your likes/playlists. Other Common room topics found based on other users similar artists/songs from your playlists would be recommended or currently existing topics that have music currently playing from your favorite artists. This would possibly be the most ambitious change as it will involve more than just the spotify API.
